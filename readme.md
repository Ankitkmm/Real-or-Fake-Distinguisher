<h3> ðŸ“Š Getting the Data and EDA Process </h3>

_The dataset was taken from Kaggle and you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaboulahia/hardfakevsrealfaces)._ <br>

The Dataset contains 1288 faces out of which

- 589 are Real
- 700 are Fake

<br>

The "fake" faces collected in this dataset are generated using the StyleGAN2, which present a harder challenge to classify them correctly even for the human eye.

# ðŸ“ˆ Results
The model with least Validation Loss was saved during the training and reloaded before obtaining the final results.
The model was able to classify all of the samples correctly.
